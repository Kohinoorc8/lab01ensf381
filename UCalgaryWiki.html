    <hr>
    <p>The University of Calgary was <b><u>established in 1966</b></u>, but its roots date back more than half a century earlier to the 
    establishment of the Normal School in Calgary in 1905. The Alberta Normal School was established in Calgary to train primary 
    and secondary school teachers in the new province. The Calgary Normal School was absorbed by the University of Alberta's Faculty 
    of Education in 1945, and operated as a part of its Calgary branch campus, a satellite campus of the University of Alberta. 
    Operating from the west wing of the Provincial Institute of Technology and Art, the Calgary University Committee was formed 1946, 
    in an effort to lobby for separate permanent facilities for the branch campus.</p>
